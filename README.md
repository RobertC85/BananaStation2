# BananaStation2
Banana Pi interfacing to a Sony PlayStation 2
# What you will need
  *banana pi m2 zzero (you could PROBABLY use a raspberry pi zero W or 2 W but i don't think there's an easy way to add the required networking capabilities via GPIO)\n
  *PlayStation 2 FAT with network / hard drive adapter\n
  *either an IDE hard drive or SATA hard drive with appropriate converter for the playstation network adapter (for the purposes of this i will suggest a 2 TB drive)\n
  *a micro SD card up to 512 gb to store all your BS2 software (including the linux software to run on the pi as well as a samba share of all your games)\n
  *basic soldering, linux and electronic skills\n
